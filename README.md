Payroll Management System (Java)
📌 Project Description
The Payroll Management System is a Java-based console application designed to manage employee payroll information efficiently. It demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by handling different employee types and calculating their salaries based on specific rules.
This project is ideal for learning OOP concepts, academic submissions, and interview demonstrations.
